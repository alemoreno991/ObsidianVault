# TODOs

- [x] Fix the booting issue when the monitor is connected

```
EFI stub: Loaded initrd from LINUX_EFI_INITRD_MEDIA_GUID device path
EFI stub: Measured initrd data into PCR 9
```

> [!Solution]
> The system does not crash. It just doesn't print to the screen. So, if you type the `password` to decrypt the disk and press `enter` everything will be fine.
