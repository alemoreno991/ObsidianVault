10:00-11:30: Helped Lucas implement a `functor` for the `OMPL` library (validityChecker)
11:30-13:45: Weekly meeting
14:30-17:30: run ALL the tests for `differential flatness`.  And, started drafting the trajectory swapping implementation strategy.


The result of the test for `differential flatness` showed that it's currently failling for:
- NonUniformRectilinearMotion (constant jerk - constant yaw) 
	- jerk = [1, 1, 0] (fails for: pos, vel, attitude, omegaB)
	- jerk = [1, 1, 1] (fails for: pos, vel, attitude, omegaB)
- NonUniformRectilinearMotion (constant snap - constant yaw) 
	- snap = [1, 1, 0] (fails for: pos, vel, attitude, omegaB)
	- snap = [1, 1, 1] (fails for: pos, vel, attitude, omegaB)
- NonUniformCircularMotion
	-  thetadot = 0.6 , heading pointing inward, simulation_time=10 (fails for pos, vel, attitude, omegaB)
- Lemniscate
	- period=10 (fail for pos, vel, attitude, omegaB)

THERE IS SOME HOPE THAT DECREASING THE STEP SIZE WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUES
