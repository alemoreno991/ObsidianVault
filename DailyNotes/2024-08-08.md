# Bug

The `_CalculateSafeTrajectory` method in the `SafeTrajectoryGenerator` class is not working properly. 

The following error occurs:
```
ERROR in validate_data: Lower bound at index 480 is greater than upper bound: 1.3000e+00 > 0.0000e+00
ERROR in osqp_setup: Data validation returned failure
ERROR in osqp_solve: Workspace not initialized
```

Additionally, I need to rethink the logic to look for the `t_safe`. Because, it seems like the `tF` is what needs to converge to the original final time of the original trajectory.


# Plan

Split the commander `_GoToGoal` method into two cases:

- [x] **Override**: detect that the drone is hovering/stationary and directly apply the new trajectory. 
	- Query the mavbridge to know the state of the drone (maybe there's a state like "hover mode")
	- Copy paste the `Swap` method of the `TrajectorySwappingLogic` but delete the part that processes the __Safe Trajectory__.
		- No need for the **cost function**.
		- No need for the **trajectory splitting feature**.
- [ ] **Swap**: detect that the drone is already following a trajectory and call the trajectory swapping logic. 
	- Query the mavbridge to know the state of the drone (maybe there's a state like "off board mode")
	- Fix the `Swap` method of the `TrajectorySwappingLogic`
		- [x] Time management
		- [x] Implement the **trajectory splitting feature**: to avoid recalculating the whole trajectory.
			- [x] Copy constructor
			- [x] Append and Prepend functions
				- [ ] Ensure continuity
			- [x] Time Shift 
			- [x] Slice function
		- [x] The time heuristic function is not correct. The problem with that is arises when trying to fit a new trajectory using the samples of the current trajectory as constraints. Note that the constraints will match the samples of the current trajectory but the timestamps associated will be recalculated, which  makes the trajectory fit to not be the same. ![[IMG_4661.jpg]]**SOLUTION**: I made all the segments have equal duration (instead of having a separate logic for the first and last segments). Homogenizing the timestamp calculation is the simplest way to provide the desired behavior, since the timestamps depend only on the distance between waypoints.
		- [x] Implement the **cost function**: to compare different solutions. 
		- [ ] Handle multiple path planners (assume at least one new trajectory has been already generated)
			- Know if you are before t_swap or not. 
				- If after => finish
				- If before => calculate trajectory and compare with the current one.
		- [x]  Handle the case when $t>t_{swap}$ 
			- Add hover trajectory to the end of safe trajectory
			- Add the logic to the trajectory generator
		- [x] Accommodate for the time it will take to solve the optimization problem. Let's say the current trajectory goes from $[t_0, t_F]$:
			- Keep the first chunk of the current trajectory $[t0, t0+\Delta t]$, where $\Delta t$ is: 
				- (if $t+t_{optimize}>t_{safe}$): The time it takes to solve the optimization problem => $\Delta t = t_{optimize}$
				- (if $t+t_{optimize}<t_{safe}$): The time left until $t_{safe}$ => $\Delta t = t_{safe} - t$ 
			- Calculate the the new trajectory from $[t_0 + \Delta t, t_{goal}]$
			- Merge both chunks to get the full trajectory $[t_0, t_{goal}]$
		- NOTICE: right now there's a bug with the optimization (see `#Bug`)

> THERE's A PROBLEM WITH THE SAFE TRAJECTORY GENERATOR ALGORITHM (but it works!! wtf???)


- [x] Implement visualizer
- [x] The `t` argument (i.e. time) of the Trajectory class should not be `double` it should be `chrono::millisecond` or `chrono::microsecond`. 
- [x] How should we represent the time?
	- Absolute: the unix time or something like that.
	- Relative to the turn-on time of the drone.
	- Relative to the time at which the trajectory is generated (current implementation).

- [ ] SQLite to store data and do post-processing analysis
