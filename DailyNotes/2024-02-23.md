# Time allocation breakdown

10:00-14:00: refactored the code and implemented tests for the controllers
14:30-17:00: refactored guidance module (now is trajectory_generator)

# Current idea to debug the controller
The euler angle sequence is 3-1-2 (I think) but it should be 3-2-1 to preserve the yaw (I think). So, maybe try reimplement it.
