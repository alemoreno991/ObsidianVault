9:30-11:00: Created the PRs to migrate the build system from CMake to Bazel ([PR#44](https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/gnc-dam-c-src/pull/44) and [PR#43](https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/gnc-dam-c-src/pull/43))
11:00-17:00: Thinking about the strategy to implement the trajectory swapping logic. I played around with some concurrency stuff in `Documents/sandbox/concurrency`
17:00-20:30: Addressed Clem's Bazel comment on  [PR#44](https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/gnc-dam-c-src/pull/44)


The last thing I was working on was [this](https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/gnc-dam-c-src/pull/43/files/b6e21c5430c3e84a14d76f612f1cbac5de794c37#diff-bcd6606a5a008b36562ce99098cd4201cb4dd862a02ca58814d77ab343d526e9). I am currently downloading the llvm toolchain into `~/Downloads/clang`. The idea is to see how could I set a custom toolchain for Bazel to make the build system as hermetic as possible. NOTE: the current implementation in both PRs use the host machine system's toolchain.
