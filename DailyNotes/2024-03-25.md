10:00:11:00: Helped Lucas solve [a problem with OMPL](https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/gnc-dam-c-src/issues/38#issuecomment-2017158529). There were a couple objects created inside a function. One of those objects owned another object as an attribute and returned a pointer to it. That pointer was then passed to an third object that was returned by the function. The problem was that the scope of the object that owned the object whose pointer was passed to the returned object was limited to the function. So, once outside of the function the aforementioned pointer was dangling, which obviously was triggering a `segmentation fault` when trying to dereference it.
11:00-13:00: Helped Pierric understand the overall diagram for GNC. We spent some time going over the concepts around the controller.
14:00-19:00: Implemented the `DimensionalPolynomial` class.
