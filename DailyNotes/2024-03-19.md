In the weekly meeting we discussed the use cases for `trajectory swapping`:

There are 4 cases:
- The user sends an *inmediate* trajectory swapping request: 
	- We come to a full stop ASAP and we plan the trajectory to the new goal from there. This is done like this because we don't know where the new goal would be.
- The user sends a new goal request that should be achieved after reaching the current goal. We can use the current goal waypoint and associated time as the transition point.
- The collision avoidance detects an obstacle that is avoidable. Then, it has a good way to determine a waypoint (on the current trajectory) at which the swap must happen at worse case. Therefore, the time at which to transition is also known.
- The collision avoidance detects an obstacle that is not avoidable if the current trajectory is followed (there is no time to come to a full stop). Then, a special way of handling this case should be implemented.
