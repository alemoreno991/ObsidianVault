10:00-24:00: Refactor the C++ code to avoid recompiling to change a parameter (e.g. step time, final time, controller-type, trajectory)
00:00-5:30 (saturday, yes I kept going): Refactor the Python code to run the `QuadcopterSimulate` binary and then plot everything.


NOTE: I couldn't clock-out because it was already saturday 5:30am (the system didn't allow me).
