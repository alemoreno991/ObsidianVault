10:00-15:00: Merged the [PR](https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/gnc-dam-c-src/pull/29)
15:00-17:00: Added an autogenerate function to the `AdimensionalPolynomial`
17:00-18:30: Adapt the build system to allow auto download and install of dependencies that don't use cmake. In particular, I focused on GSL (GNU Scientific Library).
18:30:20:00: Talked with Lucas about some OMPL problem he was facing (`safisfiesBound(State *)` function or something like that)
20:00-21:00: Managed to finish the implementation of the build system I described before.
