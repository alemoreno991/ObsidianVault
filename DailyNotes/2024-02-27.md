10:00-11:00: implemented a wide-variety of tests for the controllers (nonuniform-rectilinear motion, uniform rectilinear motion, uniform circular motion, nonuniform circular motion)
11:00-11:30: talked with Pierric about PX4 and Gazebo simulation.
11:30-13:45: weekly meeting with Roland and the GNC team.
14:30-17:30: design the GNC Architecture for [Trajectory Swapping](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6v-RBnRsr2DjDT0vbqJ1h9y9F4ysCRc/view?usp=sharing)

Tasks from the weekly meeting:
- [ ] Compile a list of dynamic effects that might be worth implementing for the physics simulation (e.g Aerodynamics, motor dynamics, blade flapping, gyroscopic effects).
- [ ] Compile a list of environmental effects that we might want to implement (e.g wind, ground effect, external forces)
- [x] Roland's question: "Can A* be used in non-regular grids?".

Long term goals (talked during the meeting):
- How to feed trajectory to the controllers?
- How to "interpolate" from previous trajectory to current trajectory?
	- Maybe freeze the current trajectory for a certain amount of time and then we plan the new one from that point onward. 

Short term goals (talked during the meeting):
- Give an end to the controller design/testing
