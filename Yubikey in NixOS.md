## Overview

The idea is to use your Yubikey to log-in or decrypt your disks and so on. This approach is safer than using passwords because it protects you from remote hacking attempts or even in the case of getting your device stolen since the perpetrator would also need your Yubikey to gain access to your device.

> [!Important]
> Make sure to have backup Yubikey stored in a safe place to avoid locking yourself out of your device.


> [!Tip]
> Ideally, don't keep your Yubikey attached to the device it's supposed to protect.
