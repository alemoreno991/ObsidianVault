# Deploy GNC v1.5.0 in the RPI

> [!Warning]
> Make sure the `/home/pi/init` directory (in the RPI) is erased before proceeding forward. 

## Bootstrapping the RPI

In your local computer you need to run the following commands to bootstrap the RPI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asus-Robotics-and-AI-Center/siv-dam-c-src.git
./tools/boostrapping/1_transfer_bootstrap_files_over_scp.sh <raspberry-pi>
```

where the `<raspberry-pi> = rpi-gnc.local` for example. 

This will copy the initialization scripts (developed by the SIV team) to `/home/pi/init`.
## Deploy Zenoh Router

> [!Note]
> You can deploy whatever Zenoh Router you want. But, make sure your `zenoh-config.yaml` is compatible with it.


```bash
cd gnc-dam-c-src/docker/zenoh-router
docker compose up
```

## Deploy GNC

> [!Warning]
> Make sure that the `zenoh-config.yaml` file is located in the `/etc/config/` directory and it is compatible with the Zenoh Router you deployed.

> [!Note]
> A default `zenoh-config.yaml` file is located in `gnc-dam-c-src/src/data/middleware/zenoh-config.yaml`

Deploy **GNC**:

```bash
cd ~/init
./3_start_gnc.sh
```
